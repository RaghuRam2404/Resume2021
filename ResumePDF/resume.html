                    After we developed APIs and exposed them to customers, we encouraged the entire Zoho CRM team to develop their features as APIs and use them in the web UI for rendering. 
                    This way we were able to build so many APIs with a single code logic for both APIs and web UI. During this
                    process, we devised various methodologies like API Audit (to make sure that the developers develop API in proper standards), common code which
                    can be made use of for easier API development etc. 
                    
                    Meanwhile, we improved our API automation framework by building our own XML-based API specification format called SPEC.
                    format called Spec. With that, we aimed to create API automation cases and generate SDKs automatically
